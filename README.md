## Hi

After the loss, all we have left is resignation.
The progress made from now on is the answer to the grief of no longer having a friend, an important motivation for me.
I would like that if we ever meet again, I will be a better person than I am today, having fulfilled the promises that were once made.

I know it will take 10 days and 500 nights to forget you, but I hope that all these moments of reflection and solitude will help me understand what you meant.

**Thank You!**
